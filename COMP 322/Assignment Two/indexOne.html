<h1>LaNyia Little</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is LaNyia and I was born on February 5, 1999 in Greensboro, North Carolina. I have two siblings, an
    older sister and a younger brother. I am a senior Computer Engineering student at NC A& T SU. I chose my major due
    to watching my dad take apart computers and put them back together when I was a child. I also chose my major due to
    going to a STEM middle school which really peaked my interest in engineering. NCAT was one of my schools of choice
    because it is the school that all of my immediate family studied at. A few of my hobbies include roller skating,
    painting, and taking road trips to discover new places. </p>
