<p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.</p>
<p>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</p>
<p>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</p>
<p>In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: </p>
<p>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</p>
<p>As his lops opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:</p>
<p>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his  loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</p>
<p>And I felt him to be more fragile still.</p>
<p>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</p>
